I pull the data from mackolik.com and I want to show you can filter that you want type. If you want to see home odds >= 1.8, you can use the filtering as I show. It helps you to decide what is going on with odds.


## Will be added
As a Jr. Data Scientist, I will try to analyze which odds wins or which odds sensible to add your following list then I will try to predict which teams can win according to historical data.


## Libraries I Used
    pandas
